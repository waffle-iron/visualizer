# A Music Visualizer

A Monstercat-styled (at least for now) visualizer, a combination of [The Nexus Avenger's](https://github.com/TheNexusAvenger/Monstercat-Audio-Spectrum-Visualizer) and [caseif's](https://github.com/caseif/vis.js/) work (mostly for the graphics as a starting point), that I've been rebuilding, and improving.

* I love open source software, and working with people, so please, feel free to give me any suggestions or thoughts you might have on this project of mine.

## Credits

* For right now, I'm just going to credit everything right here; in the future I will clean up/move the credits to a more proper location

* [Linea Icons](linea.io) by [Dario](dario.io)
* [The Nexus Avenger's](https://github.com/TheNexusAvenger) and [caseif's](https://github.com/caseif) work were my starting point for this project of mine.
